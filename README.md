# LogicTables
NodeJS app that generates truth tables from inputted arguments

## Workflow
This is a tiny project that is only hosted on GitHub so that I can sync changes between my laptop and my school-issued Chromebook running a REPL. Git workflow will _not_ be followed and commits will be extremely infrequent (only when transferring devices).
