\justifying
\noindent This argument is invalid because case 3 is a counterexample.

\noindent This argument is not sound because it's invalid.

\subsection*{Proof of Invalidity}
Consider the case where R is false and B is true. In this case, R$\rightarrow$ B is true, B is true, and R is false. Thus, all the premises are true but the conclusion is false. This is a counterexample, so the argument is invalid.
